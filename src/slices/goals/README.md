# Goals Slice

## Overview

The Goals slice manages financial goals and savings targets. It helps users set, track, and achieve financial objectives such as emergency funds, vacation savings, large purchases, or long-term investments. The slice provides progress tracking, milestone celebrations, and intelligent projections.

## Architecture

This slice follows the Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) pattern:

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Goal

```typescript
import { GoalService } from './slices/goals';

const service = new GoalService(state, dispatch);

const newGoal = service.createGoal({
  name: 'Emergency Fund',
  targetAmount: 10000,
  currentAmount: 0,
  targetDate: new Date('2024-12-31'),
  accountId: 'savings-account-id',
  category: 'emergency',
  priority: 1,
  notes: 'Build 6 months of expenses'
});
```

### Adding Contributions

```typescript
// Add $500 to emergency fund goal
service.addContribution('goal-123', 500, 'checking-account-id');

// Check if goal is now complete
const goal = service.getGoalById('goal-123');
if (goal?.isCompleted) {
  console.log('Goal achieved! ðŸŽ‰');
}
```

### Tracking Progress

```typescript
const goal = service.getGoalById('goal-123');

console.log(`Progress: ${goal.progress}%`);
console.log(`Saved: $${goal.currentAmount} of $${goal.targetAmount}`);
console.log(`Remaining: $${goal.remainingAmount}`);
console.log(`Days left: ${goal.daysRemaining}`);
console.log(`On track: ${goal.isOnTrack ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`);
```

### Getting Recommendations

```typescript
// Get suggested contribution amount
const suggestion = service.suggestContribution('goal-123');
console.log(`Recommended monthly contribution: $${suggestion}`);

// Check goal feasibility
const feasibility = service.analyzeGoalFeasibility(goal);
if (feasibility.score < 0.5) {
  console.log('Warning: Goal may be difficult to achieve');
  console.log('Recommendations:', feasibility.recommendations);
}
```

### Querying Goals

```typescript
// Get all active goals
const activeGoals = service.getActiveGoals();

// Get goals by priority
const highPriorityGoals = service.getGoals({ priority: 1 });

// Get completed goals
const completedGoals = service.getCompletedGoals();

// Get goals by category
const vacationGoals = service.getGoals({ category: 'vacation' });
```

### Using Components

```tsx
import { GoalForm, GoalProgress } from './slices/goals';

// Goal form
<GoalForm
  goal={selectedGoal}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
/>

// Goal progress
<GoalProgress
  goal={goal}
  onContribute={handleContribute}
  onEdit={handleEdit}
  showHistory={true}
/>
```

## Goal Categories

- **Emergency**: Emergency fund, rainy day savings
- **Vacation**: Travel and vacation savings
- **Purchase**: Large purchase planning (car, house, etc.)
- **Education**: Education fund, courses, tuition
- **Retirement**: Retirement savings
- **Debt**: Debt payoff targets
- **Investment**: Investment goals
- **Custom**: User-defined categories

## Milestone Celebrations

Goals celebrate achievements at key milestones:
- **25%**: First quarter milestone
- **50%**: Halfway celebration
- **75%**: Three-quarter milestone
- **90%**: Almost there!
- **100%**: Goal achieved! ðŸŽ‰

Each milestone can trigger:
- Visual celebration animation
- Notification message
- Progress badge
- Social sharing option (future)

## Validation Rules

Goals must satisfy the following constraints:

- **Name**: Required, minimum 3 characters
- **Target Amount**: Must be positive number > 0
- **Current Amount**: Must be >= 0 and <= target amount
- **Target Date**: Must be in the future (for new goals)
- **Account ID**: Must reference an existing account
- **Priority**: Must be between 1 and 5

## Testing

The slice includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Model Tests** (`Goal.test.ts`): Domain logic validation
- **Component Tests**: UI behavior and rendering
- **Service Tests**: Business logic and calculations
- **Integration Tests**: Goal-transaction-account interactions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run goal-specific tests
npm test -- goals
```

## Progress Calculation

Progress is calculated using multiple factors:

```typescript
// Basic progress
progress = (currentAmount / targetAmount) * 100

// On-track calculation
expectedAmount = (elapsedDays / totalDays) * targetAmount
onTrack = currentAmount >= expectedAmount

// Projected completion
averageContribution = totalContributions / numberOfMonths
remainingMonths = remainingAmount / averageContribution
projectedDate = currentDate + remainingMonths
```

## Performance Considerations

- Goal calculations cached and updated incrementally
- Projection calculations optimized
- Contribution history paginated for large datasets
- Real-time updates via state management

## Best Practices

1. **SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
2. **Priority Setting**: Focus on high-priority goals first
3. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions
4. **Realistic Targets**: Set achievable amounts and dates
5. **Track Progress**: Review regularly and adjust as needed
6. **Celebrate Milestones**: Acknowledge achievements
7. **Emergency First**: Prioritize emergency fund before other goals

## Common Patterns

### Automatic Goal Funding
```typescript
// Automatically allocate budget surplus to goals
const budgetSurplus = calculateBudgetSurplus();
if (budgetSurplus > 0) {
  const highPriorityGoal = service.getGoals({ priority: 1 })[0];
  if (highPriorityGoal) {
    service.addContribution(highPriorityGoal.id, budgetSurplus, accountId);
  }
}
```

### Goal Adjustment
```typescript
// Adjust goal based on changed circumstances
const goal = service.getGoalById('goal-123');
const feasibility = service.analyzeGoalFeasibility(goal);

if (feasibility.score < 0.3) {
  // Goal is too aggressive, adjust
  service.updateGoal(goal.id, {
    targetDate: new Date(goal.targetDate.getTime() + 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // Add 90 days
  });
}
```

### Multi-Goal Priority Management
```typescript
// Distribute available savings across multiple goals
const availableAmount = 1000;
const activeGoals = service.getActiveGoals()
  .sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);

let remaining = availableAmount;
for (const goal of activeGoals) {
  if (remaining <= 0) break;
  
  const needed = goal.remainingAmount;
  const contribution = Math.min(needed, remaining * 0.4); // 40% max per goal
  
  service.addContribution(goal.id, contribution, accountId);
  remaining -= contribution;
}
```

## Error Handling

The service implements comprehensive error handling:

- Invalid goal data returns validation errors
- Contribution amounts validated
- Non-existent goal IDs return null
- Insufficient funds prevented
- Date validation for target dates
